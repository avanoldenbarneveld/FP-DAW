# FP-DAW · Web Development Training

This repository collects my materials for the official **Ciclo Formativo de Grado Superior en Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Web (DAW)** (online, Navarra).

The goal is to centralize summaries, notes, and assignments in a clean, version-controlled way that reflects the structure of the official curriculum while showing how I work and learn.

## Repository structure

Each top-level folder corresponds to one official module:

* `0373-Lenguajes-de-marcas`
  Markup languages and web formats: HTML, basic CSS, XML, syndication (RSS/Atom), XML schemas, document transformation, and data storage formats.

* `0483-Sistemas-informaticos`
  Computer systems fundamentals: software and hardware, Windows and Linux installation and administration, users and permissions, backups, basic security, and introductory networking.

* `0484-Bases-de-datos`
  Relational databases: data modeling, ER diagrams, SQL (DDL, DML, queries), data processing, stored programs, and an introduction to object-relational databases.

* `0485-Programacion`
  Programming foundations (Java as main language): algorithms, control structures, methods, classes and objects, encapsulation, collections, files, interfaces, and database access.

* `0487-Entornos-de-desarrollo`
  Development environments and practices: IDE configuration, source control, debugging, testing basics, documentation, optimization, and UML diagrams for structure and behavior.

* `Avisos-generales-del-ciclo`
  General information and administrative notes for the DAW program: key dates, evaluation rules, and links to official regulations.

Inside each module you will typically find:

* `Info-general` → overview of objectives, evaluation criteria, and references.
* `UTXX-*` folders → one per unit ("Unidad de Trabajo"), with summaries, exercises, and supporting material.

This layout mirrors the official study plan so progress is easy to follow.

## How to read this repo

This is a **learning archive**, not a polished product.

* Notes are mostly in Spanish and written in my own words to reinforce understanding.
* Content focuses on concepts, examples, and workflows I actually use later in real projects.
* Administrative and legal information is summarized in `Avisos-generales-del-ciclo` with references to official sources from the Navarra education department and the training center.

If you are:

* **A recruiter or collaborator** → this repository shows the theoretical and academic base that complements my practical work with JavaScript, React, Node.js, and full-stack development.
* **A DAW student** → you can use the structure as inspiration for organizing your own material, but always rely on your official documentation for current rules and requirements.

## Academic context

This repository is based on the official DAW curriculum in Navarra and materials provided by the training center (CIP Politécnico de Estella and related documentation). It is intended solely for study, review, and personal reference.

## Usage & notes

You are welcome to read and navigate these notes. Please do **not** reuse them verbatim for graded submissions or pass them off as your own work.

This repository exists to document structured learning, make progress transparent, and keep my formal education aligned with my day-to-day development practice.
